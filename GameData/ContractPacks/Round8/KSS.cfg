    description = The CEO of Probodobodyne Inc is furious!  He's blaming poor sales of his pet project, the Oscar-B fuel tank, on consumer preference of the ROUND-8 fuel tank.  As a result, he's converting all new ROUND-8 tanks to store Xenon to boost Oscar-B sales.  We need to upgrade @/targetVessel with some ROUND-8 tanks to show their usefulness.
