description =  The CEO of Probodobodyne Inc is furious! He's blaming poor sales of his pet project, the Oscar-B fuel tank, on consumer preference of the ROUND-8 fuel tank. As a result, he's converting all new ROUND-8 tanks to store Xenon to boost Oscar-B sales. Now he's heard about a plan to save the ROUND-8 and he is not happy! He's willing to pay anyone who will destroy Probodobyne's stock of ROUND-8's

completedMessage = You've made the CEO very happy. Someone's up for a promotion!
